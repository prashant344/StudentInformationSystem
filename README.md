Student Information System

This project is for managing student information. The home screen shows the grid view of students with their id and name in form of tiles. Each tile represents each student.
Clicking on student tile will take you to student details page where details of that student will be shown. 
The details page shows the name, roll no, class and marks obtained in each subject by the sudent.
The details page also contains a bar graph representing the graph of marks obtained by student in each subject.
The top navigation bar contains a search bar which can be used to search the student based on the name of the student.
The search is performed as soon as you type any text or remove text and the search is filtered out and shown in the dashboard in tiles format.
The top navigation bar contains two buttons where first button is used to sort by name and second button is used to sort by total marks obtained by student.
